# Embedded_Lab
## Introduction
This repository contains all the information, data acquisitions, videos, and source codes used for the report.

Each main folder is described below.

## Repository Structure

### 📁 Data Analysis
This folder contains MATLAB scripts and datasets collected during laboratory sessions.  
Inside each lab subfolder, a dedicated README file provides additional details on the use and the meaning of the scripts.

### 📁 Report
This folder contains the final report and its complete LaTeX source files.

### 📁 Videos
This folder includes several videos recorded during experimental tests.  
All of them are linked where appropriate within the report, in order to have an explanation of what is happening.

### 📁 Source C Code
This folder contains the complete laboratory projects, as well as `main.c` files for easier access to the implemented code.

> **Note:** Only Labs 1, 4, and 5 are included:
> - **Lab 5** introduces the transition to FreeRTOS.
> - **Lab 4** also includes functions developed in Labs 2 and 3, which were preparatory to Lab 4. These functions remain in the source files even in the case in whuch they are no longer actively used.
> - **Lab 1** is included because it featured a different .ioc configuration, and its original functions are not present on the subsequents lab.
