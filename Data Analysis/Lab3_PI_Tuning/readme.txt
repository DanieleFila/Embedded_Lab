SECTION: STEP RESPONSE COMPARISON (StepResponseComparison.m)
========================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The script 'StepResponseComparison.m' performs a comparative analysis 
between the real-world motor behavior and the theoretical MATLAB simulation.

It plots and compares:
1. Real Closed-Loop Response: Data acquired from the motors using the 
   PI controller values experimentally tuned by the team.
2. Simulated Response: Data generated by MATLAB using the motor's transfer 
   function, where the controller parameters were optimized using 
   MATLAB's built-in 'pidtune' function.

OBJECTIVE
---------
The goal is to validate the motor model and assess the performance difference 
between the manual experimental tuning and the automated theoretical tuning.

DEPENDENCIES & SETUP
--------------------
- Data Source: Loads .mat files from the 'data' subfolder.
- Helper Functions: All custom functions used by this script are located 
  in the 'extra_functions' subfolder.
- Pre-requisites: Please read the "% NOTE" section inside the script header 
  before execution to ensure correct file paths and configuration.

SECTION: ANTI-WINDUP ANALYSIS (AntiwindupComparison.m)
========================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The script 'AntiwindupComparison.m' provides a comparative analysis of the 
controller's performance with and without the Anti-Windup mechanism. 
It loads specific .mat files from the 'data' subfolder to compare datasets 
acquired under identical operating conditions (e.g., Forward & Coast mode, 
same reference speed).

KEY OBSERVATIONS
----------------
The comparison highlights the effects of integral windup:
- WITH Anti-Windup: The control input remains within managed bounds.
- WITHOUT Anti-Windup: The input calculated by the microcontroller rises 
  rapidly due to the accumulation of error. 

*IMPORTANT PLOTTING NOTE*: In the "No Anti-Windup" scenario, the control 
signal values become extremely high. To preserve the readability of the 
graphs, these values are deliberately truncated in the plots. Without this 
truncation, the scale would be distorted, making the signal analysis impossible.

DEPENDENCIES & SETUP
--------------------
- Data Source: Loads .mat files from the 'data' subfolder.
- Helper Functions: All custom functions used by this script are located 
  in the 'extra_functions' subfolder.
- Pre-requisites: Please read the "% NOTE" section inside the script header 
  before execution for specific file configurations.

SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION FILES
--------------------------
Before running the scripts, please take note of the following files included 
in this folder for reference and documentation purposes:

1. 'antiwindup_blockDiagram.slx'
   - Purpose: This Simulink model is provided SOLELY for generating the 
     control block diagram images used in the final report. 
   - Note: It is NOT intended to be run as a dynamic simulation.

2. 'motors_params.txt'
   - Content: This text file contains the First Order Plus Time Delay (FOPTD) 
     parameters characterizing the motors.
   - Source: These values were calculated experimentally during the Lab 2.
